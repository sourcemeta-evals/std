Standards
---------

This library provides schemas that encode aspects of the following standards.
Note that these standards often contain concepts and specifications that cannot
be represented as schemas. We extract and formalize the portions that can be
expressed as JSON Schema definitions.

## :page_facing_up: License

While the project is publicly available on GitHub, it operates under a
[source-available
license](https://github.com/sourcemeta/registry/blob/main/LICENSE) rather than
a traditional open-source model. You may freely use these schemas for
non-commercial purposes, but commercial use requires a [paid commercial
license](https://www.sourcemeta.com/#pricing).

> We are happy to discuss OEM and white-label distribution options for
> incorporating these schemas into commercial products.
