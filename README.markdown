Standards
---------

This library provides schemas that encode aspects of the following standards.
Note that these standards often contain concepts and specifications that cannot
be represented as schemas. We extract and formalize the portions that can be
expressed as JSON Schema definitions.

## :page_facing_up: License

While the project is publicly available on GitHub, it operates under a
[source-available
license](https://github.com/sourcemeta/registry/blob/main/LICENSE) rather than
a traditional open-source model. In summary, you can freely make use of these
schemas for non-commercial purposes. However, commercial usage requires a
commercial license. Read the
[license](https://github.com/sourcemeta/std/blob/main/LICENSE) for more
details. We also provide OEM and white-label distribution for incorporating the
schemas as part of another commercial product.
